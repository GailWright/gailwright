    <p>What would 5-10 hours of face time with your clients do for your business?</p>

      <p>Not all projects are the same and so I offer my clients three different plans. </p>
      <p>By the hour, by retainer or by project.</p>

        If I could give you 5-10 hours per week away from your administrative and marketing tasks and allow you to use that 5-10 hours with your own paying clients â€“ how much more money could you make each week?
