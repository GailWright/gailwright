        <p>By now you already know my name is Gail Wright.&nbsp; I will be the backbone of your business ! </p>
        <p>You will find my experience and wealth of knowledge across a broad spectrum of fields and industries highly advantageoues to your business. </p>
        <p>I began my career as an apprentice Instrument Fitter in a small mining town in the Northern Territory, Australia.&nbsp; At that time I was the first female in a non-traditional role. &nbsp; Going into an ALL male environment  straight from an ALL girl's boarding school - Let's just say it was not without its challenges. </P>
        <p>I then went on to complete another apprenticeship as an electronics communications technician with Woodside Offshore Petroleum . Once again this was a ground breaking role because I was their first female apprentice. &nbsp; I believe this is where my passion for technology started. &nbsp; I now have a need to have all the latest and greatest Tech!</p>
        <p>Since then I have worked for major department stores and hardware suppliers as an Investigator . &nbsp; Yes I know, very different from my beginnings, however my background provided me with strong analytic skills that have provided me with opportunities to change my career once again.</p>
        <p>I moved to the UK and my career took me down the technology path , which I love :) </p>
        <p>I worked for a software house as Office Manager and User Acceptance Tester.&nbsp In this role the ability to manage the office and multi-task was paramount to be effective in the marketplace.&nbsp; I was Receptionist, Contract Admininstrator, HR , Payroll Administrator, Data Entry Clerk , CRM Administrator, Events Manager, Training Co-ordinator ,1st and 2nd line suppport to customers etc.... </p>
        <p>Upon moving back to Australia I once again worked for Software houses providing Administration, Systems Support, Training and Documentation working for major players in the Mining & Resources sector; much of this work involved Fly-in Fly-out to remote locations.</p>
        <p>More recently I  worked in the Utilities sector in the Accounts Payable and Receivables along with other administrative tasks such as Fleet Management Support. </p>
