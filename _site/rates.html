    <p>Ask yourself, what is your time worth?
    Are you bogged down by administrative tasks that keep you from getting  money generating tasks done?

    As a Virtual Assistant, I can help you with everything from administrative assistance to website design and creation, bookkeeping, data entry and the list goes on and on...

    As a small business owner, did you know that trying to do everything yourself is costing you 40-60% in lost revenue?

    If I could give you 5-10 hours per week away from your administrative and marketing tasks and allow you to use that 5-10 hours with your own paying clients – how much more money could you make each week?

    What would 5-10 hours of face time with your clients do for your business?
