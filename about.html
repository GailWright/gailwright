        <p>I began my career as an apprentice Instrument Fitter in a small mining town in the Northern Territory, Australia.&nbsp; At that time I was the first female in a non-traditional role. &nbsp; Going into an ALL male environment  straight from an ALL girl's boarding school - Let's just say it was not without its challenges. </P>
        <p>I then went on to complete another apprenticeship as an electronics communications technician with Woodside Offshore Petroleum . Once again this was a ground breaking role because I was their first female apprentice. &nbsp; I believe this is where my passion for technology started. &nbsp; I now have a need to have all the latest and greatest Tech!</p>
        <p>Since then I have worked for major department stores and hardware suppliers as an Investigator . &nbsp; Yes I know, very different from my beginnings, however my background provided me with strong analytic skills that have provided me with opportunities to change my career once again.</p>
        <p>I moved to the UK and my career took me down the technology path , which I love :) </p>
        <p>I worked for a software house as Office Manager and User Acceptance Tester.&nbsp In this role the ability to manage the office and multi-task was paramount to be effective in the marketplace.&nbsp; I was Receptionist, Contract Admininstrator, HR , Payroll, Administrator, Data Entry Clerk , CRM Administrator, Events Manager TrainingCco-ordinator ,1st and 2nd line suppport to customers etc.... </p>
        Upon moving back to Australia I once again worked for Software houses and provided training and Documentation
